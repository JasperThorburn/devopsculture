### Our three target outcomes remain the same...

1. Build/extend your “DevOps Toolkit” by getting hands on experience
1. Progress work and thinking on key challenges and opportunities

### At the end of this course you should be able to:

1. Identify how to configure and extend an environment in a way that can be repeated, versioned and automated.
1. Understand core DevOps concepts through hands-on practice
1. Explore the philosophy behind DevOps and how it can be applied iteratively during the life of your projects
1. Describe how you can approach DevOps in your own projects

### This course is NOT:

* Death by Powerpoint
* Theoretical exercise
* Exact answers and tools for use in your project
* A showcase of IBM tooling
