![DevOps is not science fiction](images/2018/10/devops-is-not-science-fiction.png)

## Welcome & Introductions

### Our three target outcomes remain the same...

1. Gain an overall understanding of the value of DevOps
2. Build/extend your “DevOps Kit Bag” by getting hands on experience
3. Progress work and thinking on key challenges and opportunities

### At the end of this course you should be able to:

1. Identify how to extend a virtual machine (VM) that you can take away to reference and practice DevOps engineering practices further
2. Describe how you can apply DevOps in your own projects
3. Apply DevOps concepts through hands-on practice
4. Explore the philosophy behind DevOps and how it should be applied iteratively during the life of your projects
5. Illustrate real-life examples of how these principles and philosophy have been applied on real GBS projects

### This course is NOT:

- Death by Powerpoint
- Theory only
- Exact answer and tools you should use on your project
- A showcase of IBM tooling
- A fake case study that does not reflect real world projects we work on
