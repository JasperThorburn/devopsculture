## Your turn - tell us about yourselves

* What you do?
* Any interesting projects you are working on?
* Who do you know in the course?
* What do you care about?
* What could may your workday brighter?

## On Your Mark...

* Divide into squads
* Record a Squad Battle Cry
* Agree on your Social Contract

## ...Break Some Ice

* Draw a picture of someone in your squad.
* Now do it again, but only draw one feature. Then get up and move one seat to your right, adding another feature to their drawing. Repeat until done.
* One more time, but draw one feature and pass it to your squadmate to the right.
