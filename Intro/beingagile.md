## Setting the scene

##### Trigger: Client asks for new feature
##### Outcome: Feature in use by client in production

- Each squad creates a Value Stream map
- Identify each of the steps in the process from trigger to outcome
- Use experience or rough estimates to guess the time taken at each step
- Identify the lag time taken _between_ each of the steps
- Count the total time taken for the Value Stream

###### What major themes do you see?
###### How can you improve Time-To-Delivery?

## What DevOps is _Not_

1. DevOps is not simply about combining Development & Operations teams
1. DevOps is not a separate team
1. DevOps is not a tool or product
1. DevOps is not a one-size-fits-all strategy
1. DevOps is not _just_ automation

### DevOps is about the _Three Ways_ (Gene Kim)

1. Left-To-Right: The forward flow of work through the entire teams, incl. controlling WIP, minimizing hand-offs, parallelizing, ...
1. Right-To-Left: Amplification and shortening of feedback loops and embedding lessons learned.
1. Culture: Fostering continual experimentation, risk-taking and fast-failure-with-learning; and that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.
